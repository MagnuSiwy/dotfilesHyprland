## Welcome!
In my (not) hidded compartment - a place where I keep stuff that most people wouldn't want to use but I don't really want to create a separate repo for. You'll find here some apps that I use daily. Config files for programs that not a lot of people use and so on. 

It is basically a placeholder for stuff I don't always remember I changed in my system or that I don't remember how I changed but I know I need.

Maybe you'll find something here that you like. If so, don't be afraid to yoink it.

### Have fun exploring!
